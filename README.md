 Don't forget to read the description before using this plugin! 

 📜Description: You can create unlimited tags. It has a menu where you can select to buy or equip the tags. To give a player permission when buying a tag you can add the command to the plugin you are using. The default plugin I used is PurePerm and PureChat.
